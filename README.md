# 480project
Final project for math 480. Seattle Swing schedule optimization problem.

Tentative Deadlines:

Saturday 2/21 - Problem formulated.

Monday   2/23 - Program created.

Monday   3/2  - Paper written. 

TODO:

1. Formulate better randomized shifts and volunteer constraints
2. Add skill requirement constraints 
3. Code up an "optimal" algorithm -- currently only have greedy one that does not guarantee an optimal solution
4. Maybe add some local optimizations to swap shifts and/or balance them out.
5. Catch edge cases and perhaps offer partial solutions for non-feasible inputs
6. Web app?
